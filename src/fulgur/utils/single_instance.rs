//! Windows single-instance coordination via TCP loopback.
//!
//! When the taskbar jump list launches a new Fulgur process with a file-path
//! argument, this module detects the already-running instance, forwards the
//! path to it over a loopback TCP connection, and lets the caller exit early.
//!
//! The listening instance receives the path, appends it to the shared
//! `pending_files` queue, and the next render frame opens / focuses the file -
//! the same mechanism used by the macOS "Open With" handler.
//!
//! Jump list Tasks ("New Tab", "New Window") send a `CMD:new-tab` /
//! `CMD:new-window` line instead of a file path. The listener pushes these into
//! `pending_ipc_commands` and the render loop dispatches them in-process.
//!
//! While a window is minimized GPUI pauses its frame loop, so the render
//! cycle would never drain the queues and the window would stay hidden until
//! the user restores it by hand. After queueing a message the listener
//! therefore restores any minimized window of this process directly with
//! thread-safe Win32 calls (see
//! [`crate::fulgur::utils::window_activation::restore_minimized_process_windows`]);
//! the resulting `WM_SIZE` resumes the frame loop so the queued message is
//! processed on the next frame.
